# MicroMouse

This is the main repository for the MicroMouse API Project.

## Introduction
Having recently heard about the [MicroMouse Comepetition](https://ukmars.org/contests/micromouse/),
I have acquired an interest in developing an online version for the same.
This project aims to provide a virtual maze with an local API to access the maze, 
and the contest will be to make a standalone mouse programs, that can use various techniques
such as:
1. [Flood fill algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill)
2. [Q Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)
3. [NEAT Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)
4. [A* Path Finding Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

And many more such algorithms, to get their mouse to the finish line as fast as possible.

## Components
The Components involved in this repository are:
1. [Maze Generator API](https://github.com/kshitijaucharmal/Maze-Generation)
2. Mouse Example (Not Completed)
3. Documentation (Not Completed)

## Usage
